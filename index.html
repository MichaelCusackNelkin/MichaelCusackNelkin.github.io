  <p>Welcome to my portfolio site! This repo will hold my porfolio of 
    Undergraduate and self-guided work in data science, machine learning, and full-stack web engineering.
    I am currently working on CodeAcademy's Full-Stack Engineering Career Path course, which takes approximately six months.
    Come back later to see my completed works!</p>
